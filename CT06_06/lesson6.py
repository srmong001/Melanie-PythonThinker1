# Recap 1
# explanation::
# total_students = int(input("How many students are there?")) << this is casting to turn it into an integer
# total_score = 0

# for i in range(total_students):
#   print(i) # 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 - looped 5 times

# for i in range(total_students)
#   score = input("What is student" + str(i+1) + "'s score?\n") << i+1 - i is iterator, go from start to end of the loop. 0-5 = 0,1,2,3,4 need turn it into int
#   total_score = total_score + score 
#   ^^new_score = current_score + 5

# working :

# total_students = int(input("How many students are there?")) 
# total_score = 0

# for i in range(total_students):
#   score = int(input("What is student" + str(i + 1) + "'s score?\n"))
#   total_score = total_score + score

# print("Total: " + str(total_score))

# average = total_score / total_students
# print("Average: " + str(average))
